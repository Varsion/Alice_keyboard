I made this KLE JSON because I couldn't find any online. I derived this from ProjectKeyboard's VIA layout and tuned it until it seemed to look close enough.

Paste contents of layout.json into "Raw data" field of http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/

DON'T TRUST THIS FOR CREATING ALICE PLATES. Yuktsi has made those files public here: https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=95054.msg2661499#msg2661499
